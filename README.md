# BEHAVIOR3PY

This is the official python version of the Behavior3 library, originally written in Javascript.

NOTE: this version still lacks specific documentation, but almost everything you need can be dig from the javascript-version.


## Main features

- Based on the work of [(Marzinotto et al., 2014)](http://www.csc.kth.se/~miccol/Michele_Colledanchise/Publications_files/2013_ICRA_mcko.pdf), in which they propose a **formal**, **consistent** and **general** definition of Behavior Trees;

- **Optimized to control multiple agents**: you can use a single behavior tree instance to handle hundreds of agents;

- It was **designed to load and save trees in a JSON format**, in order to use, edit and test it in multiple environments, tools and languages;

- A **cool visual editor** which you can access online;

- Several **composite, decorator and action nodes** available within the library. You still can define your own nodes, including composites and decorators;

- **Completely free**, the core module and the visual editor are all published under the MIT License, which means that you can use them for your open source and commercial projects;

- **Lightweight**!
